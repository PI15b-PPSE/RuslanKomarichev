    	"message": "Organize frequently visited sites in a convenient menu of visual bookmarks\ninstead of a blank browser page. Bookmarks can be divided into folders, and\nfolders - into other folders. You can quickly open a bookmark or folder from\nany other tab using keyboard shortcuts. Each folder can be stylized. If you\ndon't want to draw attention to a bookmark, it is not necessary to hide it\nsomewhere far away, but you can only hide its preview and/or title and\narrange it as it conveniently does. The structure of the bookmarks can be\neasily synchronized between different devices or saved to disk.\n\nWhy does this extension needed various permissions?\n- Store unlimited amount of client-side data:\n    - storing of information about bookmarks and folders;\n    - storing of settings;\n- Access browsing history:\n    - compiling a list of proposals during the creation of the bookmark;\n- Access browser tabs:\n    - opening bookmarks in existing or new tabs;\n    - processing keyboard shortcuts for navigating bookmarks from the keyboard;\n- Access data on other sites (optional):\n    - retrieve information about pages while creating bookmarks (page title,\n      icon, screenshot-preview);\n    - placement on the pages of interface elements for navigation from the\n      keyboard;\n- Hide and show browser tabs:\n    - request pages info (title, icon, preview screenshot) without displaying a\n      new tab on the tabs panel when creating or updating bookmarks."
